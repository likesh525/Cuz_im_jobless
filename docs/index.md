# **Welcome to the Wine Health Review**

You must be thinking — what's the purpose of this? Well, I don't know.  
My friend was bragging about visiting a vineyard and how good the wine was, and how *healthy* it is.

No issues — but dude is using health as a reason to drink wine.  
Bro is an alcoholic and we all know it.

## **How jobless am I?**

That's a question I ask myself.  
I have nothing better to do on a Saturday night.  
Well, take a peek if you want to.

### **Anyhow, I have a favour to ask**

Look at the image below and tell me she is *not* suffocating the poor cat...  
I say she is, and she’s denying it, saying she’s “petting it.”

Or why does it look like, *she's about to choke that cat?*
