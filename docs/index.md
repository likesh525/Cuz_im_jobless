# **Welcome to the Wine Health Review**
We all have that one person who keeps bragging about how healthy wine is and why everyone should drink it. If you've wondered whether your friend is right... or maybe just an alcoholic, this review paper is here to help!

## **Why do we do this?**
As you can imagine, I have a friend who wants to drink wine guilt-free. Since I’m currently jobless, I figured this would be a fun way to spend a Friday evening.

### **Who is Gwen?**
**Oh, I’m glad you asked.** Meet **Ms. Gwen**—the superhero Baguio didn’t know it needed. By day, she’s a mild-mannered overachiever, top of her class but humble about it. But by night? She’s out there fighting crime, rescuing cats from trees, and making sure everyone gets their groceries delivered on time.

You might be thinking, “But... she looks so tiny!”

or why does it look like, 'She is about to choke that cat'  

To which we say...

“Let’s ask her!”
