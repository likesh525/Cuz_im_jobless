## **What’s the final takeaway...?**

1. There’s no such thing as a *safe* or *healthy* low-level alcohol consumption — don’t fall for that myth.  
2. If you want to drink wine, drink it because you enjoy it — **not** because you think it’s a health supplement.  
3. You can get antioxidants — in *much higher quantities* — from other foods like fruits, vegetables, teas, and even plain grape juice.

That’s it.  
All the research papers and references I used for this are listed below. Feel free to check them out.

**Good day!**
