According to Halliwell and Gutteridge, antioxidants function at multiple points in the oxidative process. In the case of lipid peroxidation \u2014 a process where free radicals damage fats in the body \u2014 antioxidants act in five main ways:</p> <ol> <li>Reducing localized oxygen concentration.  </li> <li>Scavenging free radicals to prevent chain initiation.  </li> <li>Binding metal ions to stop them from producing radicals.  </li> <li>Breaking down peroxides to prevent them from restarting the oxidative cycle.  </li> <li>Interrupting radical chain reactions that cause further damage.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Basic/#what-is-oxidative-stress","title":"What is Oxidative Stress?","text":"<p>Oxidative stress refers to an imbalance between pro-oxidants (like reactive oxygen species) and antioxidants in the body. When pro-oxidants outweigh antioxidants, reactive species can damage essential biomolecules \u2014 including DNA, RNA, lipids, and proteins.</p> <p>These reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced naturally in the body through mitochondrial activity and other cellular processes. However, external factors like smoking, pollution, UV radiation, and toxins can also elevate ROS levels.</p> <p>\u26a0\ufe0f Note: While ROS are necessary for certain immune responses (like attacking viruses), excess levels can lead to mutations, inflammation, and diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders.</p>"},{"location":"Basic/#what-is-lipid-peroxidation","title":"What is Lipid Peroxidation?","text":"<p>Lipid peroxidation occurs when free radicals target polyunsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes.
